  Hi there! I'm a student at Harvard originally from the small mountain-town of Logan, Utah. I'm always in pursuit of stories, human connection, warmth, and design that makes you feel something. (Also snacks and long hikes.)
  
  Recently, I've been thinking about patience, ambiguity, and paying attention.
